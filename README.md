# Digital Land Frontend

## Templates

 - All templates for HTML pages used within digital land applications will be written in Jinja and use the file extension `.jinja`. 

 ## Components

 - Frontend components will use Jinja templates and will be organised so that the associated Sass/CSS and Javascript will exist in the same directory.
